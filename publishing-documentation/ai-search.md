# AI Search

Help your users find the information they need faster with powerful knowledge discovery tools for your published content

### Choose your site’s search experience

GitBook sites offer different search experiences depending on what you want for your users:

* **Keyword search** – A standard search experience based on keywords. Automatically enabled on all sites.
* **GitBook AI search** – Users get short answers to questions directly from the search box.
* **GitBook Assistant** – Users get an advanced, interactive chat experience with GitBook’s AI agent. Head to [GitBook Assistant](gitbook-ai-assistant/) to learn more.

To choose your site’s search experience, open your site’s dashboard, navigate to the **Settings** page and choose **AI & MCP** from the menu on the left. Here you can choose your preferred experience.

{% hint style="warning" %}
When GitBook Assistant is enabled, AI search is disabled. Standard keyword searches will always provide the results in the search bar no matter which experience you choose.

## Searching published documentation

**​**Users can open the **Ask or search…** bar by pressing <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> on Mac or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> on PC.

Your users can search for keywords within your docs site and jump quickly to specific pages or page sections across your entire site.

If your docs site has multiple [sections](site-structure/site-sections.md), the search results will contain pages from all of these sections so that you users can jump straight to the page they need.

## GitBook AI search

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature is available on [Premium and Ultimate site plans](https://www.gitbook.com/pricing).
{% endhint %}

GitBook AI search offers basic AI-powered answers in the **Search and find…** bar of your site. It’s trained on the content of your docs site, but cannot pull in information from external sources.

### Using GitBook AI search

If you have enabled GitBook AI search from your site’s settings page, your users can access it by asking a question directly in the **Ask or search…** bar at the top of the page.

They can open this by clicking it directly, or by pressing <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> on a Mac or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> on a PC.

As well as a summarized answer, below your users will also see an expandable section that shows the sources that GitBook AI used to create its answer, plus related questions you can click as a follow-up.

{% hint style="warning" %}
GitBook AI does not work across individual published spaces on different [docs sites](publish-a-docs-site/).

Multi-space search is only available when viewing published spaces that live as [site sections](site-structure/site-sections.md) within the same site.
